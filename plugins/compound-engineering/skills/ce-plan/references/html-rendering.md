# HTML Rendering

This is a format-rendering reference — it describes how to render any
artifact in HTML, independent of which skill is producing it.

It is paired with a section contract (`plan-sections.md`,
`brainstorm-sections.md`, etc.) that describes *what* the artifact contains.
This reference describes *how* HTML specifically presents it. The same
content rendered by different skills shares the same HTML principles.

The HTML artifact is the *only* artifact the skill produces for that run —
output mode is exclusive (markdown OR HTML, never both). Downstream
consumers (`ce-work`, `ce-doc-review`, human readers) read the HTML
directly. The agent-consumability rules below make that work.

## Hard invariants

These hold regardless of which skill produced the artifact.

- **Single self-contained HTML5 file.** No companion `.css`, `.js`, or
  `.svg` files. CSS lives in `<style>`. SVG lives inline. Images are
  base64 data URIs or inline SVG. The one permitted exception is a
  `<link rel="stylesheet">` to a CDN webfont CSS endpoint (Google Fonts,
  Bunny Fonts, etc.), paired with an offline-readable fallback font stack
  so the doc remains readable if the CDN is unreachable.
- **All metadata appears as visible text — single source of truth.**
  The artifact's metadata (title, type, status, date, etc. — exact
  fields per-skill, defined in the section contract) renders as visible
  HTML elements that downstream agents and humans read. There is no
  hidden machine-readable copy (no `<script type="application/json">`
  frontmatter block, no `data-*` attribute mirror). One representation
  for each value, which avoids drift risk and keeps the doc readable
  by linear text scan.

  Convention for editable metadata: render the value as element text
  content (`<span class="status">active</span>`, `<h1>{title}</h1>`,
  `<time datetime="2026-05-12">2026-05-12</time>`). Tools doing status
  flips (`active → completed`) update via a single Edit on the visible
  element. The text-and-attribute redundancy in `<time>` is acceptable
  because the attribute is a parser hint, not a hidden copy.
- **Stable IDs as anchor IDs AND visible text.** Every ID-bearing item
  (R-IDs, U-IDs, A-IDs, F-IDs, AE-IDs, KTDs) gets `id="r1"` on its
  element AND appears as visible text inside the element (e.g., the
  text "R1." inside the table cell or heading). Downstream agents find
  the ID in source the same way they find it in markdown.
- **Source / composition signal.** A footer (or other staleness signal)
  names the composition timestamp and the source identifier (the user
  prompt context, the upstream brainstorm doc when one exists, or just
  the composing skill name when there's no external source). Under
  exclusive output mode this signal carries the artifact's own
  provenance — there's no markdown sibling to reference.
- **ASCII identifiers.** Class names, element IDs, data attribute names
  are ASCII-only.

## Precedence stack for style preferences

Honor user style preferences in this order (highest to lowest):

1. **In-session conversation** — explicit direction the user gave this run.
2. **Preferred stylesheet reference** named in loaded agent-instruction
   context (typically `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, but scan loaded context;
   don't enumerate locations). The reference may be a file path
   (`docs/style.css`), a URL, a named library ("Tailwind"), or a style
   brand ("Stripe docs"). Agent-instruction files carry deliberate
   agent-aware preferences, so this tier sits above DESIGN.md.
3. **DESIGN.md** discovered on the filesystem (see "DESIGN.md discovery"
   below).
4. **Fallback default** — the opinionated palette / typography choices the
   agent makes when no preference exists.

### Active-recall at compose time

Before writing the CSS, scan loaded context for any stylesheet reference
the user has indicated for documents like this. If found and inlinable
(short local file, fetchable URL within budget), inline it into `<style>`.
If found but not inlinable (large framework, paywalled stylesheet, named
system without a fetchable source), compose CSS in its spirit — typography,
color, density cues drawn from the named system. Only fall back to the
default style when no preference signal exists.

The single-file invariant is preserved either way. External
`<link rel="stylesheet">` is permitted only for CDN webfont CSS (with the
offline fallback font stack); never link to an external stylesheet
carrying layout, color, or typography rules the doc cannot read offline.

### DESIGN.md discovery

When tier 3 of the precedence stack applies, look for a DESIGN.md file in
these locations, first match wins:

1. Worktree root (resolve via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`).
2. `docs/DESIGN.md`.
3. `.compound-engineering/DESIGN.md`.

Read once at compose time. Absent → fall through to the fallback default.

Worktree-root only — do not fall through to a main checkout. Users
working from a worktree who want HTML defaults can add DESIGN.md to the
worktree.

## Format principles

These shape what "good" HTML looks like; the agent applies them per
artifact based on content.

### Markdown source is content, not design

When markdown (or markdown-shaped chat context) is part of the input, use
it for semantic content — what the doc is about, what sections exist,
what facts each section establishes. Do NOT treat its bullet-vs-table
presentation choices as authoritative; re-choose the rendering per
content shape in HTML's richer affordance space. If the markdown rendered
13 requirements as a bulleted list, that does NOT mean HTML must render
them as a list — ask whether 13 items sharing `ID + body` shape deserve
a table.

### Prose is authoritative

When a visualization disagrees with the surrounding prose, the prose
governs. If they diverge, the visualization is wrong.

### Text contrast is local

Every text-on-background pairing must hold up on its own. A color that
works for prose on the page background does not automatically work for
a small label inside a tinted container. The most common violation:
applying a generic "muted" text variable (calibrated for prose-on-bg) to
secondary text inside an accent-soft / warn-soft / info-soft container.

Test by reading each filled shape's labels at the rendered scale. If the
subtitle or secondary text feels washed-out against the fill, the choice
is wrong for that local context — pick a color from the same family as
the fill (accent-text for accent-soft, etc.) or drop the muting entirely
and rely on font-size and weight for hierarchy.

### Body bold not colored by default

Reserve accent text color for status chips, ID chips, links, and section
borders. Do NOT color `<strong>` in body content by default. Bold weight
already carries emphasis; applying accent color to every `<strong>` in a
long list overwhelms the eye, especially in dark mode. CSS should leave
`strong` at `color: inherit` unless a specific surface (status pill, ID
chip) is being styled.

### No JS framework runtimes

A small inline `<script>` for active-section TOC tracking or anchor-
permalink behavior is acceptable. React, Vue, Svelte, or any framework
runtime is not. The single-file invariant doesn't permit framework
bundles, and the artifact's longevity doesn't warrant a build dependency.

## Section anatomy

How section types commonly render in HTML. These are patterns, not
contracts — the agent picks shapes that fit the content.

- **Summary / Problem Frame** — semantic `<section>` with prose
  paragraphs. Optionally precede with an eyebrow label (small-caps tag
  above the title) for editorial polish.
- **Requirements** — `<table>` is the default at 5+ uniform items;
  bullets at smaller counts. Each row has the R-ID as visible text in
  its own column. Consider adding a "covered by" column for reverse
  traceability when ID-anchored items have downstream references in
  the same doc.
- **Implementation Units** — repeating `<article>` cards with a stable
  ID chip (visible "U1" text), a metadata strip (`<dl>` with field
  labels and values for Goal, Files, Dependencies), and secondary
  content (Approach, Test Scenarios, Verification, Patterns to Follow)
  inside `<details>` collapsibles. All collapsibles start closed by
  default — the metadata strip is the primary surface; subsection
  labels are clickable affordances for readers to expand on demand.
- **Key Technical Decisions** — repeating cards with the decision ID,
  bold decision title (often with inline code for technical
  identifiers), and prose rationale. Flat cards (not collapsibles) —
  these are reference material readers scan, not drill into.
- **Risks** — color-coded cards with status eyebrow (e.g., "RISK ·
  MITIGATED" / "OPEN · DEFERRED FOLLOW-UP") and prose body. Color of
  the left-border or accent communicates status at a glance.
- **Scope Boundaries** — callout cards with color-coded left borders
  (in-scope vs deferred vs outside) when the distinction is meaningful.

The agent picks more elaborate or simpler shapes based on what each
specific artifact's content needs.

## Diagrams

When the section contract calls for a diagram (architecture, sequence,
flowchart, state machine, swim lane, data-flow, quantitative
comparison), HTML renders it as **inline SVG**. The agent picks the
shape that conveys the content fastest — there is no fixed catalog of
"approved" diagram types. If the content is quantitative comparison
across categories, a bar chart is the right shape; if it's component
relationships, a topology diagram; if it's process flow across
participants, a swim lane; etc.

### Layout legibility for hand-authored SVG

The agent designs SVG coordinates without rendering — layouts that look
fine in source can collide in practice. Before emitting, trace each
labeled arrow and each text label:

- **No arrow path passes through a text label.** If an arrow line or
  curve crosses a label's bounding box, the text reads as struck-through
  and the arrow reads as terminating at the wrong element. Fix by
  re-routing the arrow, moving the label, or applying
  `paint-order: stroke fill` with a stroke color matching the diagram
  background to halo the label. The halo width is a judgment call:
  narrow enough not to bleed into glyph strokes (a halo whose width
  approaches the glyph's own stroke width muddies the text color), wide
  enough to mask underlying arrows (at least the arrow's stroke width
  plus a hairline). Verify by inspecting rendered text at the target
  font size — if glyphs look thicker or more colored-toward-halo than
  the same text outside the diagram, the halo is too wide.
- **Arrow labels sit adjacent to the arrow's midpoint** (typically
  within ~10-15px above or beside the line they describe). A label
  floating at the diagram's edge that readers have to trace back to an
  arrow is broken — readers will misread.
- **Avoid long curves that traverse the diagram** to connect a
  component on one side to one on the other. If A and D need a labeled
  connection across a multi-component layout, prefer reordering boxes
  so A and D are adjacent, numbered step badges next to each
  participant that the caption ties together, or a short
  labeled-channel notation — rather than one curve crossing multiple
  unrelated elements.
- **Differentiate diagram shapes by geometry first, by fill semantics
  second.** Geometry (diamond = decision, rect = step, oval =
  start/end, parallelogram = data) carries the role unambiguously.
  Fill semantics (accent-soft for highlighted path, warn-soft for
  fallthrough) carry meaning. Resist introducing additional neutral-tint
  tiers (a slightly-lighter grey to mark "decision shapes are different
  from boxes") — when geometry already differentiates, an additional
  luminance tier adds no information and creates fragility: small RGB
  deltas survive native browser rendering but can be flattened or
  inverted inconsistently by dark-mode extensions, accessibility
  plugins, or printing.

### Plan architecture diagrams are not directional sketches

Do not add hedging captions or section preambles to plan SVG diagrams —
phrases like "directional guidance for review, not implementation
specification" do not belong on plan diagrams or on unit-card
technical-design subsections. Plan diagrams render the same authoritative
content as the surrounding prose; the prose-is-authoritative rule
already governs disagreement. Hedging language is reserved for the
wireframe affordance below, which carries a *required* directional
caption because the wireframe is explicitly NOT a spec.

## Wireframe mockups (requirements docs only)

When a brainstorm requirements document describes a user-facing visual
surface (UI feature, screen layout, screen flow, component placement),
the HTML rendering may include a wireframe mockup. This affordance applies
ONLY to brainstorm requirements docs that describe visual products — not
to plan artifacts, and not to brainstorms about non-visual systems (API
design, agent workflows, infrastructure).

When a wireframe is included:

- **Fidelity ceiling: wireframe, not mockup.** Gray boxes for layout
  regions, text labels for content placeholders, intentional placeholder
  copy (`[Product name]`, `[CTA label]`, `[user avatar]`). No
  pixel-perfect colors, no exact typography choices, no specific
  component-library references. The wireframe communicates spatial
  arrangement and structure, not visual style.
- **Static only.** Inline SVG or simple HTML/CSS for layout. No JS
  interaction, no working form fields, no state changes, no live data.
- **Anti-padding.** One wireframe per distinct visual concept.
- **Mandatory directional caption.** Every wireframe carries an explicit
  "directional, not the spec" note adjacent to it. Required wording (or
  close paraphrase): *"Directional only — illustrates the intended
  user-facing shape. Exact colors, spacing, copy, and component choices
  are placeholders for review, not requirements."*

Without this caption the wireframe risks being read as a binding visual
spec, which the affordance is explicitly designed to avoid.

## Affordance idioms

Common HTML affordances the agent can reach for when content benefits.
These are examples, not requirements — the agent picks what each
artifact's content warrants. Other affordances not listed here are
fine when the content suggests them.

- **Sticky TOC sidebar with active-section indicator** for long docs
  (5+ top-level sections, or ~400+ rendered lines). Two-column layout
  on desktop, collapsed to top-of-page on mobile, paired with a small
  inline `IntersectionObserver` script that toggles `.active` on the
  matching nav anchor.
- **Eyebrow labels** (small-caps tag above section titles) for
  editorial polish, especially when section titles are narrative
  rather than literal.
- **Stats strip** at the top of the doc when the artifact has 3+
  quantifiable signals worth surfacing at a glance.
- **`<details>` + `<summary>`** for collapsible secondary content
  inside repeating cards. All collapsibles start closed — `open`
  attribute should not appear on any `<details>` inside repeating
  cards by default.
- **Side-by-side columns** for parallel content (Request / Response,
  Before / After, Two alternatives).
- **Tinted callout cards** for content that is "different in kind"
  (Deferred, Open Questions, advisory notes) — color-coded left
  borders communicate kind at a glance.

## Agent-consumability rules

Downstream agents (`ce-work`, `ce-doc-review`, future consumers) read the
HTML file as text linearly, not via DOM extraction. Compose so semantic
understanding is reachable in source:

- **Use semantic HTML over `<div>` soup.** `<article>` per unit card,
  `<dl>` for metadata pairs, `<table>` for tabular content, `<details>`
  / `<summary>` for collapsibles, `<section>` for top-level doc
  sections. Structure markers carry meaning to a text-reading agent.
- **Render field labels as visible text, not as attributes.** Emit
  `<dt>GOAL</dt><dd>...</dd>`, not `<dd data-field="goal">...</dd>`.
  The label is the semantic anchor.
- **Keep U-IDs, R-IDs, and similar as visible text** in headings and
  table cells, not only as `id=""` attributes. The agent finds "U1." in
  source the same way it finds "U1." in markdown.
- **Match section heading vocabulary to what the section contract
  defines.** When the section contract says "Implementation Units," the
  HTML heading is "Implementation Units" — not "How we'll build it,"
  even if the narrative version reads better. Section heading
  vocabulary is the contract downstream consumers grep for. (Editorial
  re-titles can appear as eyebrow labels, sub-headings, or visual
  framing — but the load-bearing section heading matches the contract
  name.)
- **All semantic content lives in actual HTML text.** No CSS `::before
  { content: "..." }` carrying meaning, no background images as
  content, no semantic info that only renders. Whatever the agent sees
  in source is what it knows.
- **Stable structure is the public API.** Element types, the ID and
  label scheme, and the field-label vocabulary do not break across
  versions. Visual styling can change freely.

## Post-compose audit

Before returning the artifact, scan it for common slips:

- **Single self-contained file.** No companion `.css` / `.js` / `.svg`.
- **No hidden machine-readable metadata copy.** No
  `<script type="application/json">` frontmatter block, no `data-*`
  attribute mirroring visible values. Metadata lives in visible text;
  one source of truth per value.
- **All stable IDs** appear as both `id=""` and visible text.
- **Section heading vocabulary** matches the section contract names
  (downstream agents grep these).
- **Source / composition signal** is present.
- **Body `<strong>`** is not colored with accent palette.
- **`<details>`** inside repeating cards have no `open` attribute.
- **Diagram labels** are legible — no arrow paths crossing text,
  halo width appropriate for font size.
- **No JS framework runtimes** included.
- **Each heading level** is visually distinct from others and from
  inline bold.
- **No template placeholders** (`{skill}`, `<value>`, `[plan title]`)
  leaked into output.
- **No process exhaust** callouts in the artifact.
